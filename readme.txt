The goal of this project is to evolve a visually guided braking agent, as proposed in 
Kadhihasanoglu et al. 2015. After that, I'll be extending the work by applying several
perturbations to the agent: perturbing the agent's mapping to brake force, acceleration, position, 
and adding a delay between action and perception.
