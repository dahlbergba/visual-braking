The goal of this project is to evolve a visually guided braking agent, as proposed in
Kadhihasanoglu et al. 2015. After that, I'll be extending the work by applying several
perturbations to the agent: perturbing the agent's mapping to brake force, position,
and adding a delay between action and perception.

TODO: I am not sure which values to initialize each optical variable as. This is
something I should look to Didem's code for guidance.
